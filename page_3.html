                   first and foremost, it's important to be patient with the person, and to give them space, just listening to them or letting them know that you're there for them is really helpful. Let them talk as little or as much as they want. Offer reassurance and let them know it's okay to struggle or feel a certain way. It's best not to make assumptions and don't try to guess their feelings or try to diagnose them.
